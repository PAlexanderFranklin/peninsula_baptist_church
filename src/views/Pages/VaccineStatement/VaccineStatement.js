        Whereas Scripture makes it clear that every human being is created
        in the image of God and that all innocent human life
        should be protected from conception to natural death, and
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas abortion destroys an innocent human life, and
      </p>
        Whereas fetal cells used in medical experimentation were
        obtained via abortion, and
      <p>
        Whereas the Southern Baptist Convention has condemned
        both abortion (2021) and the use of fetal cells in
        medical experimentation (1992), and
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas fetal cells obtained via abortion were used in
        the development and/or production of certain vaccines,
        including all covid-19, rubella, chicken pox, and hepatitis A vaccines available in the United States (https://lozierinstitute.org/cell-lines-used-for-viral-vaccine-production/ and https://lozierinstitute.org/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-covid-19-vaccine/ ), and
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas covid-19 and other vaccines are available outside
        the United States without use of fetal cells in
        either development or production, and
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas the continued use of vaccines developed or
        produced with fetal cells will encourage the abortion
        of more babies in the future to replenish the supply of fetal cells, and
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas David set the example that drinking water obtained
        through danger to his men was equivalent to drinking
        their blood and therefore refused (2 Samuel 23:15-17), and
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas we should not encourage our brothers to violate
        their conscience (1 Corinthians 8 and Romans 14), and
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas many Christians find it a violation of their
        conscience to benefit from vaccines which use fetal
        cells, be it therefore
      </p>
      <p>
        Resolved, that we, the members of Peninsula Baptist Church,
        support and commend the resolutions of the Southern
        Baptist Convention concerning both abortion and fetal experimentation, and further be it
      </p>
      <p>
        Resolved, that we support the conscience rights of
        our fellow believers to refuse any vaccines which use
        fetal cells in development or production, and further be it
      </p>
      <p>
        Resolved, that we call upon the various federal and state
        governments to recognize the religious freedom to
        refuse any vaccines which use fetal cells, and further be it
      </p>
      <p>
        Resolved, that we call upon the US Federal Government
        to encourage the development and/or importation of
        vaccines which do not use fetal cells, and further be it
      </p>
      <p>
        Resolved, that we call upon the Southern Baptist
        Convention to adopt a similar resolution concerning
        the use of fetal cells in vaccines.
